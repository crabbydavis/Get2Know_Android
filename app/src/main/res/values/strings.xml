    <string name="game_info"><u><i>Normal Game Play:</i></u>\nThe normal game play is for two players who want to see who knows the other one better! A question will be posed and each player will enter their answer. Then, in turn, each player tries to guess their opponent\'s answer among other auto-populated answers. The first player to guess correctly 3 times wins(unless there is a need for a tie-breaker).\n\n<u><i>Free Play:</i></u>\nThe Free Play option can be used for groups or if you just want to get to know someone without playing the game (which is lame). You are able to cycle through as many questions as your heart desires!"</string>
